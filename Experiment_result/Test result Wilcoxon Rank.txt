Compare the recall error of optimized models and that of not optimized one, for sampling strategy: none
H0: median of recall error from optimized models = median of recall from not optimized one
H1: median of recall error from optimized models < median of recall from not optimized one
P-value is 0.0, therefore h0 is rejected!

Compare the recall error of optimized models and that of not optimized one, for sampling strategy: under
